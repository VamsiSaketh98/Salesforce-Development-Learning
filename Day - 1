Welcome to my Salesforce learning repository! 
This is where I track my progress and document what I've learned about Salesforce development.

What I've Learned Today
Apex Programming
1. Primitive Data Types
Boolean: Represents true or false values.
Integer: Represents whole numbers.
Double: Represents floating-point numbers.
Long: Represents larger whole numbers.
Date: Represents calendar dates.
DateTime: Represents date and time.
String: Represents a sequence of characters.
2. Non-Primitive Data Types
List: An ordered collection of elements, similar to arrays in other languages.
Set: An unordered collection of unique elements.
Map: A collection of key-value pairs where each key is unique.
3. sObjects
Salesforce objects that represent records in the database, such as Account, Contact, etc. sObjects can be manipulated using Apex to interact with Salesforce data.
